Let's clarify what L1, L2, L3 for DeepStack outputs might refer to in this context:
* **L1 (Collector Output):** `deepstack_collector_output.json` (the raw data).
* **L2 (Analysis Gem - EIR Summary):** `DeepStack Snapshot for [Company Name].gdoc` (concise, strategic).
* **L3 (Analysis Gem - Detailed Report):** `DeepStack Ground Truth Report for [Company Name].gdoc` (comprehensive, technical, for Hunter/MEA).

And for Deep Research outputs, you mentioned two versions. I see:
* `2A - Deep Research Brief for Glean`
* `2B - Deep Research Brief for Glean with ground truth` (This one explicitly states it "leveraging the Ground Truth Report on Glean.com's client-side technical intelligence 1 as a launchpad for deeper inquiry" [cite: 36]). This seems to be the enriched version.

Here's the revised Mermaid diagram annotated with these specific file names and output levels:

**Explanation of Annotations and Flow in the Diagram:**

1.  **DeepStack Collector Script (`deepstack_collector.py`):** This is your Python script that scans websites.
2.  **`collector_output.json` (L1 - Raw Data):** The direct JSON output from the Collector. This is the primary input for the DeepStack Analysis Gem.
3.  **DeepStack Analysis Gem:**
    * Guided by `System_Instructions_DeepStack_Analysis_Gem.gdoc` and the `_README-DeepStack Analysis Gem` (formerly `DeepStack v2.gdoc`) for overall context.
    * Uses `Instruct_DeepStack_Snapshot.gdoc` to produce the **`DeepStack Snapshot for [Company Name]` (L2 - EIR Summary)**. This instruction document is informed by the style of `Actual Marketing Analysis Example by Maria P`.
    * Uses `Instruct_DeepStack_GroundTruth.gdoc` to produce the **`DeepStack Ground Truth Report for [Company Name]` (L3 - Detailed Technical Analysis)**.
4.  **"Revelatory Insights Hunter":**
    * Executes the `Prompt for DeepR B2B SaaS Marketing Insights`.
    * Crucially takes the `DeepStack Ground Truth Report` (L3) as a foundational technical input.
    * Their process might yield an initial internal version and then an enriched version, like your two examples for Glean:
        * `Initial Deep Research Output` (e.g., `2A - Deep Research Brief for Glean`)
        * Which then becomes the `Enriched Deep Research Brief for [Company Name]` (e.g., `2B - Deep Research Brief for Glean with ground truth`) that explicitly leverages the Ground Truth report.
5.  **MEA Gem:**
    * Guided by its own comprehensive set of instructions (`System Instructions: B2B SaaS Marketing Analysis Gem (v4)`, `Instruct_Marketing_Analysis`, `Marketing Analysis Methodology`, `Marketing Analysis Rubrics`, and `Strategic_Elements_Framework`).
    * Takes the `Enriched Deep Research Brief for [Company Name]` as its primary strategic input.
    * Produces the `Marketing Effectiveness Analysis (MEA) Report` (e.g., `MEA - Glean`).
6.  **CMO EIR:** Receives the `DeepStack Snapshot` (L2), the `DeepStack Ground Truth Report` (L3) for reference, the `Enriched Deep Research Brief`, and the final `MEA Report` to synthesize and deliver distilled strategic advice.

This annotated diagram maps your actual file names and the concept of layered outputs (L1, L2, L3, and the two versions of the Deep Research Brief) onto the workflow. It should give a very clear picture to any new ChatBot instance picking up this project.
